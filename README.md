# Renterly

## Project Description

As a renter, I would like a web app that allows me to track my rental history, show my recommendations from other roommates and landlords, and list my contact info.

## Acceptance Criteria

I can create a new login, password, and access my profile page.
I can register as either a renter user or a property manager user.
As a renter user, I can add my previous addresses, contact info.
As a renter user, I can upload a photo.
As a renter user, I can request recommendations from other renters or property managers.
As a renter user, I can add recommendations to other renters.
As a landlord, I can add recommendations to renters.
The renter profile page will display these items for public views, but a login is necessary to create and edit a renter profile.
